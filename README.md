# Beginner Projects

## 📌 About This Repository

**Beginner Projects** is my public learning journal as I continue developing my skills in computer science and software engineering. This repository documents my journey from building simple, foundational projects to more complex, real-world applications.

As a recent graduate with a **Computer Science degree**, I created this repo to:
- Reinforce and expand on the fundamentals I learned in school
- Learn by building, breaking, and improving projects
- Practice writing clean, understandable code
- Track my growth over time while learning in public

## 🎯 Goals

- Build consistency through hands-on practice  
- Strengthen problem-solving and debugging skills  
- Explore different areas of the tech industry  
- Develop a portfolio of progressively challenging projects  

## 🧭 Focus Areas

The projects in this repository may touch on one or more of the following areas:

- **Software Development**
  - Core programming concepts
  - Object-oriented design
  - Data structures & algorithms
  - Small applications and utilities

- **Cybersecurity**
  - Security fundamentals
  - Defensive programming concepts
  - Ethical security experiments (learning-focused)

- **Automation**
  - Scripting repetitive tasks
  - Workflow automation
  - Productivity tools

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project typically includes:
- A brief description of the problem it solves
- Notes on what I learned
- Challenges encountered
- Possible future improvements

Projects are added as I progress, so earlier projects may be simpler or less polished than later ones—and that’s intentional.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is a **work in progress**. Some projects may be incomplete, experimental, or revisited later as my skills improve.

## 🤝 Learning in Public

Feedback, suggestions, and discussions are welcome. If something can be done better, I want to learn it.
